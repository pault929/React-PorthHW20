    <p>Dad, Coder, Coach, Mentor, Bartender, Uncle, Colombian, Entreprenuer, and much more! But for now;
Coding is on the plate and the goal. This is my second go around in Coding, I finished a program at CUNY Tech Works recently and want to continue growing. 
I prefer the Web Design / Front End side of coding, but am liking and picking up more the back end.
Hobbies include: cooking, cycling, traveling - when possible, horseback riding, coaching, and public speaking of all things. I believe in giving back to the youth of our country/community and also to our seniors who need help and company; especially here in New York City. Ideally I'd like to find an opportunity with a company that provides growth and development, with the anticipation of working remotely from where ever my passport takes me.</p>
